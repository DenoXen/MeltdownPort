# MeltdownPort
Geometry Dash Meltdown for Windows. This is not an actual port, this is a modification of the base game client, to look and act like the Meltdown app for mobile devies.

## How-to

WIP, do it yourself if you're able to :P

## What doesn't work
- Loading savegames from the server won't unlock icons.
- In the garage, every color has a gray lock (on the original game it's gray only for premium colors).
  
## Todo
- Disable online save feature (this is also disabled on the original game, as 2.2/the merge feature is not out yet).
- Change guardian text.
- Add low-res assets.
- Change assets path to the mobile one.
- Change window title.
- Change exe icon.
- Remove steam completely.
