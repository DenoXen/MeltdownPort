# MeltdownPort
Geometry Dash Meltdown for Windows. This is not an actual port, this is a modification of the base game client, to look and act like the Meltdown app for mobile devies.

## How-to

WIP, do it yourself if you're able to :P

## What doesn't work
- Loading savegames from the server won't unlock icons.
- In the garage, every color has a gray lock (on the original game it's gray only for premium colors).
- Free Stuff button not works, because there no function about that
  
## Todo
- All is Done!

## Features

- Full Version Button
- Deleted some buttons
- Changed assets path to the mobile one.
- Changed exe icon.
- Removed steam completely.
